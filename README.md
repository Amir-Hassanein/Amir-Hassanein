### Senior Mentor, Auditor, and Technical Interview Lead @ Udacity

I contribute daily to Udacity's great mission of making people in demand by:
 * Providing our students with Technical Project Reviews.
 * Technical support on Knowledge Platform.
 * Hand-picking new Mentors through Technical Interviews.
 * Hosting Mentoring Sessions.
 * Plagiarism Investigation to ensure only those who learned the required skills earn The Nanodegree Certificate.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Applied Statistics for Business from Helwan University with an accumulated GPA of 3.0 with a decent number of courses in Data Analysis.
